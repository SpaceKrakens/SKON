# SKEMA

SKEMA (sensational spelling for schema) is the schema language for [SKON](./SKON-v1-Spec.md). 

It's meant to be a fully featured schema language for SKON while still conforming to the fundamental ideas behind SKON, simple, concise, easily read and written language.

It's only meant to describe a SKON file and nothing else.

## Terminology

This section contains definitions for a few words that will be used in the document.

- **could** is used when a parser could optionally support the directions, but in a general sense should be considered not supported.

- **should** is used when there could be reasons for a parser to not follow the specification, **should** is a strong recommendation and should be assumed to be supported in a general sense. If a parser does not follow these directives it should advertise this clearly!

- **needs** is used when the parser is required to follow the directives to conform to the SKEMA specification.
