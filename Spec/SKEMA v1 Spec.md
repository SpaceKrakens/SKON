# SKEMA

SKEMA (sensational spelling for schema) is the schema language for [SKON](./SKON%20v1%20Spec.md). 

It's meant to be a fully featured schema language for SKON while still conforming to the fundamental ideas behind SKON, simple, concise, easily read and written language.

It's only meant to describe a SKON file and nothing else.

## Terminology

This section contains definitions for a few words that will be used in the document.

- **could** is used when a parser could optionally support the directions, but in a general sense should be considered not supported.

- **should** is used when there could be reasons for a parser to not follow the specification, **should** is a strong recommendation and should be assumed to be supported in a general sense. If a parser does not follow these directives it should advertise this clearly!

- **needs** is used when the parser is required to follow the directives to conform to the SKEMA specification.

## Encoding

SKEMA is written in `UTF-8` and that is the only encoding a parser **needs** to support. A parser **could** support other encodings but is not be expected to.

## Grammar

This section is only important for people interested in making a parser for SKEMA.

SKEMA is designed as a context free language. This means that it's possible to parse SKON effectivly using an `LL(1)` parser.
The official grammar is defined as a ANTLR4 combined grammar, though an `ALL(*)` parser as ANTLR4 uses is not necessary to parse SKEMA, any `LL(1)` parser should work.

The official grammar can be found [here](../Grammar/SKEMA.g4).

## Syntax

The syntax rules that apply to SKON also applies to SKEMA.
Every value **needs** end in a comma and a file **should** be a implicit map.

### Metadata
---

SKEMA uses the same metadata format as SKON, seen [here](./SKON%20v1%20Spec.md#metadata).

This means that SKEMA requires parsing of both SKEMA objects aswell as SKON data.

All metadata **should** be at the top of a SKEMA file.

Metadata entries are surrounded by `~` chracters on both sides and contain a key-value pair.

There are two metadata directives a parser **needs** to support. 
These are as follows:

- `Version` which is followed by an integer. This is the SKEMA language version.
- `DocumentVersion` which is followed by any datatype. This is used in applictaion to filter versions of a file.

A `Version` metadata directive is required at the top of every file.

A parser **could** support custom metadata, but to keep compatability it **should** not force these to be present.

#### Example

This is an example of a valid metadata header for a SKEMA file.

```c
~Version: 1~
~DocumentVersion: "1.1"~

// SKON data...
```

### Type
---

This is the main functionality of SKEMA. These are used to represent the simple data types in SKON.

The valid types are as follows:

- `Any`:
  Maches any SKON data type.
- `String`:
  Maches the String data type.
- `Integer`:
  Matches the Integer data type.
- `Float`:
  Maches the Float data type.
- `Boolean`:
  Maches the boolean data type.
- `DateTime`:
  Maches the DateTime data type.

It's worth noting that because Type is a data type it should be followed by a comma.

#### Examples:

- `String,`
- `DateTime,`
- `Any,`
- `Integer,`

### Array
---

An array is a complex type in SKEMA and describes a SKON array specified to only contain one data type.

This data type is not limited to the simple type [Type](#type) but can also be another array or [Map](#map).

An array is written as a [Type](#type) enclosed in `[ ... ]` brackets.

#### Examples:

- `[ String ],`
- `[ [ Integer ] ],`
- `[ { Key: Any, } ],`

### Map
---

A map is a complex type in SKEMA that describes a SKON map, what keys and type of data those keys should have.

A map is written as Key-Value pairs where the key represents the expected SKON key and the value is a data type.

The data type is not restricted to [Type](#type) and can contain other Map and [Arrays](#arrays) too.

#### Examples

- `{ Key: Any, },`
- `{ AnotherKey: String, KeyToInt: Integer, },`

### Optional
---

An element of a Map can be defined to be optional by writing 'optional' before the key.

#### Example

```scala
// This element is optional
optional Key: String,
// while this element is required
AnotherKey: Integer,
```

### Definitions
---

A definition is used to store and reuse common data structures in multiple places.

To define a data structure you just need to write `def` before a key in a Map.

If there are multiple definitions for the same name the earlier definitions are overwritten.

Any data type can be defined.

#### Examples

- `def StringDef: String,`
- `def ArrayDef: [ Integer ],`

```scala
def MapDef:
{
  def AnotherDef: [ Integer ],
  Key: Float,
},
```

### References
---

References are used to refer to and use definitions.

A reference is written as a `#` followed by the name of the defined data structure.

#### Example

```scala
def Person:
{
  FirstName: String,
  LastName: String,
  optional Nickname: String,
},

People: [ #Person ],
```

## Reference solving

A parser **should** support definitions and references.

The references **should** be solved after the whole document has been parsed,
 by first making sure there are no [strongly connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component) and then substituting all references with their matching definition.

When detecting strongly connected components `optional` elements should not be traversed.

If there are any strongly connected components the SKEMA has recursing definitions and cannot be resolved!

This way of resolving references allows for semi-recursive SKEMAs to be constructed like the following:

```scala
def Node: 
{
  Value: Any,
  opt Nodes: [ #Node ]
},

Tree: #Node
```

## File format

The filename extension for SKEMA is `.skema`.
